#### Intro
- This is my study using tutorial which is originated from  
https://github.com/Keess324/Multi-label-Image-Classification-  

- To have prerequisites on dataset, files, reviewing order, etc,
read this file in the project
`Instructions of Reading Files.docx`

- I translate original Keras code into PyTorch code with adding my functions.

- Project and its dataset are from  
https://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space

#### Libraries
- TensorFlow: v1.10.0
- Keras: v2.2.4
- CUDA: V10.0.130
- cuDNN: v7.4.2
- Tqdm
- etc

#### Used techniques
- Multi labels (for example, image1 can have 3 labels)
- XGBoost
- CNN
- SIFT

#### Metrics
1. Exact Match Ratio (MR)
2. Hamming Loss (HL)
3. Godbole et Measure (Considering the partical correct)
